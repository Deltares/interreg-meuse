Therefore, the lakes are modelled as a prismatic lake with area A and the storage func 1: S = A*H. As of latest Wflow version (PR#250), overflow is included for lakes and based on maximum storage derived from the storage func, so S_max = A * H_max. Three reservoirs are included in the model: the Rurtalsperre (combined with the Urfttalsperre and Vortalsperre as 1 big reservoir), the Oleftalsperre and the Wehebachtalsperre. The Wehebachtalsperre is difficult to calibrate as it lies in the zone affected by lignite mining and has very low outflows (0.1 m3/s < Q < 0.2 m3/s>)."
